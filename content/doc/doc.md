We maintain a set of reference documentation for users looking to run FRR. We
also maintain a reference for current and aspiring FRR developers which
documents many aspects of our development workflow in addition to the FRR
process architecture and some data structures common across FRR daemons.

Both sets of documentation are recommended-reading before using or contributing
to [the FRR repository](https://github.com/FRRouting/FRR) on GitHub.
