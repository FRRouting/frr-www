FRRouting Release 8.0 Available for Download
==============================================

*July 29, 2021*

The FRR community is pleased to announce FRR 8.0.

In this release there are over 2200 commits from 91 different authors.

Please note that we expect to release a bugfix point release relatively soon after this release.

* Github Release    - https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/releases/tag/frr-8.0
* Debian Packaging  - https://deb.frrouting.org/
* RPM Packaging     - https://rpm.frrouting.org/

Snaps will be delayed by several weeks; when available they will be published here:
* Snap Packaging    - https://snapcraft.io/frr


Due to the absence of a suitable `libyang2` package for Alpine Linux, Docker builds will also be delayed.

## Changelog

### Major changes

#### Behavior
* Many users are familiar with vtysh's "walk up" behavior. If a command is entered which isn't valid in the current CLI context mode, vtysh will "walk up" to higher, more general contexts and attempt to evaluate the command there. In prior releases, this would happen if the command entered was ambiguous for the current context. This caused more problems than it was worth and so in this release the behavior has been changed so that vtysh will no longer walk up when an ambiguous command is entered. Some users that have configurations which rely on this behavior may notice that their configurations no longer work. This should be a very small minority of users but please keep it in mind if you start seeing weird configuration issues.

#### Features

* A new daemon, `pathd`, has been added. This daemon implements support for segment routing. Documentation is currently lacking, but there are example configurations to look at
  [here](http://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/pathd.html).

* EVPN Multihoming is now fully supported

* OSPFv3 now supports VRFs

* TI-LFA has been implemented in IS-IS and OSPF

* Zebra now has the ability to dump netlink messages in a human-friendly format

* LDP gained SNMP support

#### Dependencies

* FRR uses [libyang](https://github.com/CESNET/libyang) to implement support
  for YANG models and related functionality. In this release we've transitioned
  to libyang2 to provide both better performance and to receive better support
  from future libyang changes. Packaged libyang2 is provided in our Debian and
  RPM repositories.
