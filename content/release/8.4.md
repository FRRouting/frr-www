## Release Overview

* New BGP command (neighbor PEER soo) to configure SoO to prevent routing loops and suboptimal routing on dual-homed sites.
* Command debug bgp allow-martian replaced to bgp allow-martian-nexthop because previously we allowed using martian next-hops when debug is turned on.
* Implement BGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community rfc8097
* Implement Route Leak Prevention and Detection Using Roles in UPDATE and OPEN Messages rfc9234
* BMP L3VPN support
* PIMv6 support

* New command to enable using reserved IPv4 ranges as normal addresses for BGP next-hops, interface addresses, etc.
* As usual, lots of bugs and memory leaks were fixed \m/
