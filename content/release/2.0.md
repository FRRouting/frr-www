# Inaugural FRRouting Release Available for Download
*April 3, 2017*

The FRRouting contributors are proud to announce that the first release of FRR is available for source [download](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/releases/tag/frr-2.0) with pre-built packages being released over the next few weeks.  The team has spent the last ten months integrating code and developing enhancements towards making FRR the best open routing suite available.

Here's a bird's eye view of some things the team has been busy working on:
- 32-bit route tags were added to BGP and OSPFv2/v3, improving route policy maintenance and increasing interoperability in multivendor environments;
- Update-groups and nexthop tracking enable BGP to scale to ever-increasing environments;
BGP add-path provides users with the ability to advertise service reachability in richly connected networks;
- The addition of RFC 5549 to BGP provides IPv4 connectivity using IPv6 native infrastructure, enabling customers to build IPv6-centric networks;
- Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) enables BGP users to operate isolated routing domains such as those used by web application infrastructures, hosting providers, and Internet Service Providers;
- EVPN type 5 routes allow customers with layer 2 data centers to exchange subnet information using BGP EVPN;
- PIM-SM and MSDP enable enterprise applications that rely on IP multicast to use FRR;
- Static LSPs along with LDP enable architects to use MPLS to engineer network data flow;
- An overhaul of the CLI infrastructure and new unit test infrastructure improves the ongoing development and quality of FRR; and
- Enabling IETF NVO3 network virtualization control allows users to build standards-based interoperable network virtualization overlays.
