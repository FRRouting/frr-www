## Release Overview

### Breaking changes

#### Enable BGP dynamic capability by default for datacenter profile

Advertise BGP "Dynamic" capability by default if using a `datacenter` profile. The dynamic capability gives more flexibility in terms of changing some parameters (e.g. Graceful-Restart, Long-lived Graceful-Restart timers, Addpath, Role, etc.) without resetting the session.

More details [here](https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/bgp.html#clicmd-bgp-default-dynamic-capability).

#### Split BGP `rpki cache` command into separate per SSH/TCP

The old [command](https://docs.frrouting.org/en/stable-10.0/bgp.html#clicmd-rpki-cache-A.B.C.D-WORD-PORT-SSH_USERNAME-SSH_PRIVKEY_PATH-KNOWN_HOSTS_PATH-source-A.B.C.D-preference-1-255) is broken at some level. When configuring a TCP session with the `source`, the command thinks it's an SSH session with a username.

More details [here](https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/bgp.html#clicmd-rpki-cache-tcp-HOST-PORT-source-A.B.C.D-preference-1-255), and [here](https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/bgp.html#clicmd-rpki-cache-ssh-HOST-PORT-SSH_USERNAME-SSH_PRIVKEY_PATH-KNOWN_HOSTS_PATH-source-A.B.C.D-preference-1-255).

#### Add deprecation cycle for OSPF `router-info X [A.B.C.D]` command

### Features

#### BGP dampening per-neighbor support

It is now possible to configure BGP dampening parameters on a per-neighbor basis. In previous releases, BGP dampening could only be configured globally or per-SAFI.

More details [here](https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/bgp.html#clicmd-neighbor-PEER-dampening-1-45-1-20000-1-20000-1-255).

#### BMP send-experimental stats

We added an option to send experimental BMP (RFC 7854) stats [65531-65534].

RFC 7854 defines BMP statistics types:

>Values 65531 through 65534 are Experimental, and value 65535 is Reserved.

More details [here](https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/bmp.html#clicmd-bmp-stats-send-experimental).

#### Implement extended link-bandwidth for BGP

By default bandwidth in extended communities is encoded in IEEE floating-point format, and is limited to a maximum of 25 Gbps. Since not every vendor implements this correctly (due to IEEE floating-point), another [draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-li-idr-link-bandwidth-ext) is implemented to encode the bandwidth into IPv6 address-specific extended community.

More details [here](https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/bgp.html#clicmd-neighbor-PEER-extended-link-bandwidth).

#### Paths Limit for Multiple Paths in BGP

Implemented this [draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-abraitis-idr-addpath-paths-limit) as an extension for the Addpath capability, that tells the sender to send only an arbitrary number of paths per prefix instead of sending all of the known paths.

More details [here](https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/bgp.html#clicmd-neighbor-A.B.C.D-X-X-X-X-WORD-addpath-rx-paths-limit-1-65535).

#### New command for OSPFv2 `ip ospf neighbor-filter NAME [A.B.C.D]`

Configure an IP prefix list to filter packets received from OSPF neighbors on the OSPF interface.

More details [here](https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/ospfd.html#clicmd-ip-ospf-neighbor-filter-NAME-A.B.C.D).

#### Implement non-broadcast support for point-to-multipoint networks

This extends non-broadcast support to point-to-multipoint networks.

The `AllOSPFRouters` (`224.0.0.5`) is still joined for non-broadcast networks since it is joined for NBMA networks.

More details [here](https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/ospfd.html#clicmd-neighbor-A.B.C.D-poll-interval-1-65535-priority-0-255).
