## Release Overview

- Handle CTRL+Z without exiting the VTY shell
  -  In the 8.3 release, the CTRL+Z combination exited the VTY shell, it's back again!
- Ignore `end` when parsing frr.conf
  - If frr.conf has `end` inside the config, BGP peering starts only after 10 minutes. This is because parsing the `end` keyword stopped hooks from reaching the end of the configuration and BGP thoughts the configuration is not ready.
