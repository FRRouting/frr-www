## Release Overview

### Centralized Management Daemon

A new daemon called `mgmtd` has been added paving the way for a new northbound yang-based management interface. `staticd` has been converted to use `mgmtd` with more daemons to follow future releases. If you use custom configuration paths you may need to adapt these to use `mgmtd`. See the documentation for more info.

### Switched to libyang minimum version 2.1.80!

The required minimum version for libyang is raised to 2.1.80. RPM/DEB packages are published on our repositories. Docker images are built using 2.1.80 also.

### Memory footprint for BGP reduced drastically!

In FRR 8.4 release, we shipped Extended Message Support for BGP, which increased the memory usage significantly. In FRR 9.0 release, the memory footprint is back to normal again. We removed the unused structure fields that consumed a huge amount of memory unnecessarily.
