FRR is actively developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr).

Releases are cut when significant features are added or important bug fixes are
incorporated into FRR. A release represents a coherent snapshot of FRR. Each

signed, packaged and widely distributed as an official release of the FRR
routing suite.

A list of all such releases is below:
