Title: Releases
---

FRR is actively developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr).

Releases are cut when significant features are added or important bug fixes are
incorporated into FRR. This typically corresponds to a release cadence of
roughly every 4 months.

FRR distributes signed DEB and RPM packages along with Snap images.
Repositories for these can be found at the following locations:

* Debian Packages - https://deb.frrouting.org/
* RPM Packages - https://rpm.frrouting.org/
* Snaps - https://snapcraft.io/frr

Docker images are also available on a best-effort basis:

https://hub.docker.com/r/frrouting/frr

Images corresponding to releases are named `frrouting/frr:vX.Y.Z`.

Source tarballs and release notes are posted on GitHub:

https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/releases

Installation instructions are available in the [user docs](http://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/installation.html).

Release notes are also posted to this website, and are identical to those on
GitHub.
