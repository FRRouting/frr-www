FRRouting (FRR) is a free and open source Internet routing protocol suite for
Linux and Unix platforms. It implements BGP, OSPF, RIP, IS-IS, PIM, LDP, BFD,
Babel, PBR, OpenFabric and VRRP, with alpha support for EIGRP and NHRP.

FRR's seamless integration with native Linux/Unix IP networking stacks makes it
a general purpose routing stack applicable to a wide variety of use cases
including connecting hosts/VMs/containers to the network, advertising network
services, LAN switching and routing, Internet access routers, and Internet
peering.

FRR has its roots in the Quagga project. In fact, it was started by many
long-time Quagga developers who combined their efforts to improve on Quagga's
well-established foundation in order to create the best routing protocol stack
available. We invite you to participate in the FRRouting community and help
shape the future of networking.

Join the ranks of network architects using FRR for ISPs, SaaS infrastructure,
web 2.0 businesses, hyperscale services, and Fortune 500 private clouds.
