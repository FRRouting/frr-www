GSoC 2020 Project Completed
==============================================

*September 19, 2020*

Jakub Urbańczyk's Dataplane Batching project was successfully completed during [Google Summer of Code 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5123816730132480/)!  Dataplane Batching is a feature we have wanted in FRR for a very long time.  Linux has supported netlink batching natively for years and many of the external dataplanes being used with FRR also support it.  Jakub’s code will be in use on routers running FRR all over the world, pushing objects including routes, nexthop groups, rules, neighbors, etc. into batch-enabled dataplanes.

Excellent work Jakub! Check out the project in his own words [here](https://urbanczyk.dev/post/gsoc2020/).
