Title: FRRouting Community
---

The FRR community organizes itself on [its Slack
instance]({{< param extLinks.slackJoinLink >}}).
Information regarding upcoming features, meetings, and developer discussion can
be found there; it is by-far the fastest way to reach out to and interact with
the FRR community.

Additionally there are [mailing lists]({{< param extLinks.mailList >}})
which host FRR discussions and relay announcements without the need to join the
Slack community.

Google Summer of Code
---------------------

The FRRouting community invites interested participants to contribute to FRR
through the  Google Summer of Code (GSoc). More details and eligibility are
available on our [GSoC portal](https://frrouting.github.io/frr-gsoc/).
