Title: FRRouting Community
---

The FRR community organizes itself on [its Slack
instance](https://join.slack.com/t/frrouting/shared_invite/enQtNjM1MTkzMDQ0Mzg2LTAxZmQ5ODk0NTE1NjZmOWNkNmJkODc3YWZhOWE3NjQ1MzI2YWMzZmViNzVmYjBhYWNkNDYwMjVkOWMzMWZkYWM).
Information regarding upcoming features, meetings, and developer discussion can
be found there; it is by-far the fastest way to reach out to and interact with
the FRR community.

Additionally there are [mailing lists](https://lists.frrouting.org/listinfo)
which host FRR discussions and relay announcements without the need to join the
Slack community.

The FRRouting community invites interested participants to contribute to FRR
through the  Google Summer of Code (GSoc). More details and eligibility are
